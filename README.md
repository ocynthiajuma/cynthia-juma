## 👋 Hi, I'm Cynthia Juma

I’m a Machine Learning practitioner with a strong background in
Computer Science and Data Science. I focus on building interpretable,
production-ready ML systems that solve real-world problems, using both
Python and R depending on the problem context.

My work combines classical statistical methods with modern machine
learning to support robust, data-driven decision-making.

### 🔍 Current Focus
- Designing ML-driven decision support systems with a focus on interpretability and real-world constraints
- Longitudinal and time series analysis for climate and population-level impact studies
- Applied ML model development with rigorous evaluation and error analysis
- Deep learning solutions for structured, temporal, and text data
- NLP and transformer-based approaches for applied analytics
- End-to-end ML system development, from experimentation to deployment and monitoring
